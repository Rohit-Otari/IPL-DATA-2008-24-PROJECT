1) There are two files names deliveries.csv and matches.csv. 
2) The deliveries file has ball to ball stats of the matches since 2008 and mathces file has match details such has toss winner, MOM etc.
3) I have done a ETL on both these files and made some other tables in power query to get other details as player names, team names etc.
4) Now, coming to the visualiztion dashboard, I have 6 pages of dashboard a) Home, b) Summary, c) Batter summary, d) Bowler summary, e) Face off b/w players and f) Champions stat.
5) Now to create all this I have used model relationships, DAX and power query with some help from Chat GPT too to be fair (ChatGPT is useful, only if you know your DAX basics).
6) You can contact me at rohitotari.career@gmail.com for any assistance or if you have any suggestions for me.
